#LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals:Getting started with Compute Engine

3#OBJECTIVES:
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

  -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.

  -Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.

  -Connect between the two instances.

#STEPS:

1. Create a virtual machine using the GCP console
	gcloud compute instances create “my-vm-1” –-zone "us-central1-a" --machine-type "n1-standard-1"--image-project "debian-cloud"
		–-image “debian-9stretch-v20190213” –-tags http –-subnet"default"

	gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=hhtp:80 --target-tags=http

2. Create a virtual machine using the gcloud command line
 	gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b

	gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"
		--subnet "default"

3. Connet between VM instanctes
   -Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network:

     -connect to my-vm-2

	gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2

     - ping my-vm-1

	ping -c 3 my-vm-1

     -use ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1 from my-vm-2

	ssh my-vm-1

   -At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:

	sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y

   -Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:

	sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html

   -Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:

		Hi from Clara Musyoka

   -Press Ctrl+O and then press Enter to save your edited file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit the nano text editor.
   -Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

	curl http://localhost/

		-Results:The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

   -To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:

	exit

   -Your will return to command prompt of my-vm-2. 

   -To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:

	curl http://my-vm-1/

		-Resutls:The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.

   -Copy the external IP address for my-vm-1 and paste 

 	gcloud compute instances list

   -Paste the copies IP address of my-vm-1 into new browser tab and hit enter 
		-Results: . You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
