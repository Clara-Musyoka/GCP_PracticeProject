#LAB: FUNDAMENTALS : GETTING STARTED WITH GKE

##OBJECTIVES:
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

 -Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

 -Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

#TASKS

1. Confirm that needed are enabled
   -Use the following commands to confirm Kubernetes Engine API and Container Registry API are enabled

	gcloud services list | grep Kubernetes

	gcloud services list | grep Container

2. Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster

   -For convenience, place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE using:

	export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a

   -Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes:

	gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

   -After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:

	kubectl version

   -View your running nodes in the GCP Console:	

	kubectl get nodes

		-Results:Your Kubernetes cluster is now ready for use

3. Run and deploy a container
   -From your Cloud Shell prompt, launch a single instance of the nginx container. (Nginx is a popular web server.):
	
	kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

   -View the pod running the nginx container:
	
	kubectl get pods

   -Expose the nginx container to the Internet:

	kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

		-Results: Kubernetes created a service and an external load balancer with a public IP address attached to it.The IP address remains the same for the life of the service.
			  Any network traffic to that public IP address is routed to pods behind the service:
			  in this case, the nginx pod.
   -View the new service:

	kubectl get services

   -Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.

   -Scale up the number of pods running on your service:

	kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

   -Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:

	kubectl get pods

   -Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:

	kubectl get services

   -Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address.

   -Refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding.
